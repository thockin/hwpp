Requirements:

  To build this you will need several libraries:
	- flex and bison
	  These should not be hard to get for just about any distro.

  	- gmp and gmpxx version 4.2.1 or higher
	  Apparently, ubuntu-dapper does not have official packages
	  that meet this requirement.  I have rebuilt the ubuntu-edgy
	  packages against dapper.

  	- boost version 1.33 or higher
	  These should not be hard to get for just about any distro.

	- fuse (if you want to build the pp_fuse application)
